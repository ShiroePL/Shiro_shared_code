![Screenshot](avatar_shiro.png)
### My attempt to create my anime waifu assistant that can write and speak in cute voice.

### Description:
My personal Ai assistant ShiroAi-chan. I wanted to create AI girl from a long time and now with really cheap and powerful model like [ChatGPT API] it's possible for anyone.

### What is this repo?
This repository has code that is shared over 3 repositories:
1. [Streamlit repo] - This is web verion of ShiroAi-chan, build with [Streamlit].
2. [Desktop repo] - This is desktop version of ShiroAi-chan, that is based on Tkinter as her GUI.
3. [Wearos repo] - This version is mobile version of ShiroAi-chan, most personal because I made it so I can use my WearOS watch to speak to her. This version uses [FastAPI] that is running in docker container.
